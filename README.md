# Wanted System Mod for GTA V

## Overview
The **Wanted System Mod** enhances the bounty and wanted level mechanics in GTA V, introducing a more dynamic system where citizens can report crimes, bounty hunters track you down, and you can accumulate and lose bounties.

## Features
- **Bounty System**: Earn a bounty when you lose your wanted level. The higher your wanted level, the bigger the bounty.
- **Citizen Reporting**: If a citizen witnesses your crimes and you are not disguised, they may report you to the police.
- **Bounty Hunters**: If your bounty exceeds $1000, bounty hunters will be dispatched to track you down.
- **Player Death Consequences**: If you die, you lose your bounty, and your money is deducted accordingly.
- **Hotkeys**:
  - `F5` - Add $1000 to your bounty manually.
  - `F6` - Reset bounty to $0.

## Installation Guide
1. Download and install **Script Hook V** and **Script Hook V .NET**.
2. Extract `WantedSystem.dll` into the `scripts` folder of your GTA V directory.
3. Launch the game and enjoy the enhanced wanted system.

## How It Works
- When you commit crimes, your bounty increases if you evade the police.
- NPCs can report you if they see your crimes and you are not wearing a mask or glasses.
- If your bounty reaches $5000, NPCs will react with fear and may call the police.
- If your bounty reaches $1000, there is a chance bounty hunters will spawn to track you down.
- If you die while having a bounty, you lose all of it, and your in-game money is reduced.

## Notes
- Bounty hunters spawn in groups and may come in vehicles if the group is large.
- The higher your bounty, the more dangerous the bounty hunters become.
- This mod works seamlessly with other police enhancement mods for a more immersive experience.

Enjoy the new dynamic crime and bounty system!
